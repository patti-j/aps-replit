The files under the 7zip folder are from the 7zip SDK. The source SDK can be found from www.7-zip.org.
These files are the actual compression methods, there is no external files or programs used to compress or decompress.
The only code file being maintained by PT is Compress\SevenZipHelper.cs which calls the actual encode and decode functions.
