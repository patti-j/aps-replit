// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Release Year: 2006
//      Release Month: 1 for January 
//      Release Day: 15 for the 15th day of the month 
//      Build number:  75 for the 75th build of version 2006.  (zero based)
//
// Don't use * in place of any of the build numbers below; the build numbers between the components
// won't be kept in sync and product validate based on version number will fail.
